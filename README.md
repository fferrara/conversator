# Conversator

Conversator is an interactive tool to design a conversational experience, AKA *chatbot*.

## Why

While building a chatbot, maybe the most important aspect is designing a pleasant conversation. It's a challenging task. Requires **empathy**, sense of humour. It also requires a tool to see the conversation structure, write text/emoji/whatever units and test the conversation flow.

This tool should be open-source, intuitive, compatible and cloud-based.

We entered the chatbot era in 2016 but, surprisingly enough, there not exists such a tool yet.

## Features

- Create conversation structure and flow visually
- Export to JSON
